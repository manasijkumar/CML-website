# Welcome to the Cognition and Memory Lab!

We are a cognitive psychology lab based in the Department of Psychology at Oberlin College, Ohio.

At the Cognition and Memory Lab, we explore how our internal cognitive states— like attention — shape the way we organize and retrieve memories. Our research investigates how everyday fluctuations in attention, as well as factors such as ADHD and aging, influence memory in both healthy individuals and those with cognitive differences. 

We use a range of methods, including behavioral experiments, computational modeling, eye-tracking, and pupillometry, to uncover the mechanisms behind memory and attention. 

Undergraduate students play a central role in our research, leading projects and gaining hands-on experience that result in conference presentations and publications.
