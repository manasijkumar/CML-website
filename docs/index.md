# Welcome to the Cognition and Memory Lab!


## About us

We are a cognitive psychology and neuroscience lab based in the Department of Psychology at Oberlin College! 

At the Cognition and Memory Lab, we examine how our internal cognitive states (e.g. our attention, intentions, etc.) during an experience can influence memory organization and retrieval, and how these processes differ in individuals with cogntive differences.  

We use a range of methods, including lab-based and online behavioral studies, computational modeling, eye-tracking, and pupillometry to address these questions. 

Undergraduate students at Oberlin College play a central role in our research, leading studies and experiments within this research program, resulting in conference presentations and publications.
