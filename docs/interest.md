# Interested in working with us at CML?

While there is no official requirement to join the lab, I do give preference to students who have completed **at least one course with me**. I strongly recommend that you complete (or concurrently enroll in) Research Methods I when you begin working in my lab.

At this time, there are no open Research Assistant (RA) positions in the lab. If you'd like to get on our waitlist, please fill the form below and we'll reach out to you when a spot opens up.
