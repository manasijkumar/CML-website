**Hello! I am a third-year student at Oberlin College majoring in Psychology and Computer Science and minoring in cognitive science. I am interested in cognitive research, specifically in memory and consciousness. I am also eager to study the intersection between Psychology and Computer Science, especially as technology becomes more present in our daily lives. I am ecstatic to join the Cognition and Memory Lab, where I have the opportunity to hone my skills in both research and programming. Outside of academics, I love fencing, playing violin, watching movies, listening to music, and hanging out with my friends!**

**I am a sophomore majoring in Psychology and Law and Society. Broadly I am interested in cognitive psychology, but more specifically, I am curious about its applications to the law such as eye witness memory biases and the impact of these biases on trial outcomes. In my spare time I enjoy staying active, reading, and making new dishes and desserts.**

**I am a second-year undergraduate student majoring in Psychology and Neuroscience. I am mainly interested in Development and Cognitive Psychology research, in the future I will possibly like to look into the way that strong emotions impact the way that we are able to store, recall and organize memories. I am extremely overjoyed to be able to be part of the Cognition & Memory Lab. Outside of academics,  I enjoy doing nails, spending time with family and friends, and reading.**
